# Brake distance calculator

This is a simple calculator to calculate the braking distance of a vehicle. It accounts for the reaction time of the driver, the time it takes for the brakes to be applied the traction of the tires and the speed of the vehicle. It can also calculate the speed of the vehicle given the braking distance. 



Velocity can be input 3 different ways:
1. As a single value
2. As time and distance traveled
3. As length of brake marks on the road
